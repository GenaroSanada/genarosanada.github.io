[That is what we made in past](https://medium.com/@GenaroNetwork).
Check those repo out in our github <https://github.com/GenaroNetwork>
Project is based on Storj V2, and multiple changes in that decentralized storage, more encrypt algo included, new bridge(satelite) created,
stake-based chain that follow the rules that staker and storage provider could collaborate with.
I just write this down to let me know there was something I've done, at least something has to be done.

Figth on!
